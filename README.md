# Databricks-14-Day-AI-Challenge
### Databricks 14-Day AI Challenge sponsored by Databricks, organized by Indian Data Club & CodeBasics

What is it:
  Databricks is a cloud-based data platform where teams analyze data, build pipelines and work with analytics, ML, AI together. 

Why we need it: 
  With ever increasing volume of data, there is a requirement for scalable processing of data, reliable handling and team collaboration. 

How it handles scalability:
  Databricks uses Apache Spark, which does distributed processes across multiple machines at the same time. 

Clusters and Spark DataFrames: 
  Clusters - group of computers
  Spark DataFrames - data distributed across these cluster (parallel process)

Lazy execution:
  All steps are optimized first and only then executed when results are required. 

Databricks SQL and delta tables:
  Databricks SQL - queries large datasets; stores and maintains that data. 
  Delta tables - version control; safe updating

Impact of AI: 
  Databricks makes EDA (explorative data analysis) easier by leveraging "Genie" - an in-built AI feature
